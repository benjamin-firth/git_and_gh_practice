"Some of my favorite places include Squamish in BC, Saint George in Utah, Puerto Rico, and Hood River in Oregon."
"I actually spent a little over a month living in Squamish, which was an incredible experience.  Not only did I get a lot of climbing in, I also was able to swim in quite a few lakes, and even on the top of a waterfall!"
"Not to be forgotten was my trip to New Zealand.  I was there for around 2 months and it was absolutely incredible."
